 1. You are given two 32-bit numbers, N andM, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a
     method to insert M into Nsuch that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume
     that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all ofM. That is, ifM= 10011,
     you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for
     example, have j-3 and i=2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
     EXAMPLE:
     Input: N = 16000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
     Output: N = 10001001100

2.     Given a real number between 0 and 7 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print
        the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary
        with at most 32 characters, print "ERROR."



3.        longest sequence



 4.  Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that
     have the same number of 1 bits in their binary representation



6.      Write a function to determine the number of bits required to convert integer A to
        integer B.
        
        
        
 7.    Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as
        possible (e.g., bit 0 and bit! are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on)        
        
        
        
8.      A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
        pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible
        by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course,
        can be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function
        drawHorizontalLine(byte[] screen, int width, intxl, intx2, inty) which draws a horizontal
        line from (x 1, y) to (x2, y)
